Welcome to my website!

My name is Mohammad Aghdami, and I am a graduate research assistant with NASA's GEDI science team at the University of Maryland, College Park. Previously, I was a research assistant at the University of Tehran, Iran, where I majored in remote sensing engineering. Over the past five years, I have worked as a geospatial data scientist, contributing to various projects in which I have both led and collaborated. Some of these projects are listed on the [projects page of my website](https://mo-agh.github.io/projects/), along with their outcomes. The tools and scripts I developed for these projects are open-source and available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mo-agh).

I specialize in machine learning and remote sensing data processing for geospatial analysis, earth observation, and change detection. My primary tools are Python and QGIS, which I use for data processing, analysis, and visualization. I have a strong interest in deep learning and big data, and I have applied these technologies to several projects. Currently, I am leading a project that uses LiDAR data to quantify changes in forest canopy height over time.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking and outdoor activities. I also play the guitar and enjoy making music with others.
