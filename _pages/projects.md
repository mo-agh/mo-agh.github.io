This page showcases the projects I have led and collaborated on, along with their results.


## Project 1: GEDI and Landsat-8 data fustion using machine learning.
This project quantified biomass loss due to saltwater intrusion in Wicomico, Somerset, and Dorchester counties, Maryland. The GEDI L4A biomass product served as the dependent variable in a random forest regression model, with Landsat-8 bands as independent variables. Landsat-8 data for the study area were collected using the Google Earth Engine platform. The trained model produced wall-to-wall biomass maps for 2013 and 2021. The following figure presents the results: (A) Landsat-8 composite of the study area, (B) GEDI data, (C) estimated biomass map for 2013, and (D) estimated biomass map for 2021. The codes for this project are available on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mo-agh/GEDI-Landsat_data_fusion).
