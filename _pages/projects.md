## Project 1: GEDI and Landsat-8 data fustion using machine learning.
This project was conducted to quantify the amount of biomass loss due to saltwater intrusion in Wicomico, Somerset, and Dorchester counties of Maryland. For this purpose, GEDI L4A biomass product was used as the dependent variable of a random forest regression model with the independent variables being Landsat-8 bands. The Google Earth Engine platform was used to collect the Landsat-8 data over the study area. The trained model was used to produce wall-to-wall maps of biomass in 2013 and 2021. The following figure shows the results; A) Landsat-8 composite of the study area, B) GEDI data, C) estimated biomass map of 2013, and D) estimated biomass map of 2021. The codes for this project can be found on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mo-agh/GEDI-Landsat_data_fusion).
